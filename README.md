Users should be able to understand/code:

- script tag
- variables
- numbers
- strings
- console.log()

- the DOM
- getElementById()

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript


### What I learned

This was a good review of basic concepts. The easy integration between onclick, and functions was nice to refresh my memory:

```html
<button id="increment-btn" onclick="increment()">INCREMENT</button>
<button id="save-btn" onclick="save()">SAVE</button>
```
Nice little trick to reset the count, and display it back to zero on the browser
```js
function save() {
    let countStr = count + " - "
    saveEl.textContent += countStr
    countEl.textContent = 0
    count = 0
}
```
The biggest nugget of wisdom was to use .textContent instead of .innerText to preserve the white spaces between the stored values
```js
function increment() {
    count += 1
    countEl.textContent = count
}
```

### Continued development

Just keep going on the career path and not be afraid to google things like ".innerTxt alternatives"

### Useful resources

- [Alternatives to innerText](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent) - The Mozilla Dev Network is proven time and time again to be a good friend for when I am in need
